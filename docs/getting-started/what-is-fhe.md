# What is FHE ?

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption** , or FHE for short, is a revolutionary cryptographic method that allows computation on encrypted data (ciphertext) directly without the need to first decrypt it! 🔒 How awesome is it to be able to execute intricate calculations or data analysis on confidential material without ever disclosing the underlying data? 🧠

### Why Is FHE Such a Big Deal? 🚀

- **Privacy-Preserving:** Sensitive data is kept secret and safe during the whole computation process when using FHE. For sectors where data privacy is critical, such as healthcare 🩺, finance 🏦, and cloud computing ☁️, this is revolutionary!

- **Versatile Applications:** FHE can be used in a variety of contexts, such as encrypted cloud storage ☁️, private machine learning 🤖, and secure voting systems 🗳️. This approach enables users to safely outsource computations without sacrificing control over their data.

- **No Decryption Is Necessary:** Conventional encryption exposes data to hazards by requiring it to be decoded prior to computation. FHE closes this problem by encrypting data constantly 🛡️.
